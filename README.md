Explanation:
1.	The arithmetic operations are defined as separate functions just like before.
2.	A dictionary named operations is used to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions. This eliminates the need for multiple if-elif statements.
3.	The main loop of the program prompts the user to select an operation symbol.
4.	Inside the loop, it first checks if the input is a valid operation symbol by checking if it exists in the operations dictionary.
5.	If the input is valid, it prompts the user to enter two numbers and attempts to perform the operation using a try-except block to handle potential errors like ValueError (if the input is not convertible to float) and ZeroDivisionError (if dividing by zero).
6.	If the input is invalid, it prints an error message
7.	After displaying the result, it asks the user if they want to perform another calculation. If the user enters "yes", the loop continues; otherwise, it breaks out of the loop and the program terminates.
8.	Title: Simple Calculator Program

Description:
This is a simple calculator program implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program utilizes advanced features such as error handling, functions, and recursion to ensure robustness and user-friendliness.

Features:
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles errors such as invalid operations and division by zero.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for input and output.
- Implemented using functions and advanced Python features for modularity and maintainability.

Functions:
1. add(x, y): Performs addition of two numbers.
2. subtract(x, y): Performs subtraction of two numbers.
3. multiply(x, y): Performs multiplication of two numbers.
4. divide(x, y): Performs division of two numbers. Handles division by zero error.
5. calculate(op, x, y): Takes an operator and two numbers as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
6. main(): The main function of the program. Handles user input, error handling, and program flow.

Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the desired arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
3. Enter the first number.
4. Enter the second number.
5. View the result of the operation.
6. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid operation, division by zero), an error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to retry.

Example:
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Result: 8.0

Enter operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 0
Error: Division by zero
Enter operation (+, -, *, /):

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x or higher
